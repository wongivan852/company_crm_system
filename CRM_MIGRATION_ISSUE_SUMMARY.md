# Actions Taken and Current Problem Summary

## Actions Performed

1. **Checked for YouTube creators in the dataset:**
   - Searched all CSVs for youtuber/handle entries.
   - Confirmed no such data in the original export.

2. **Pulled latest repo changes:**
   - Pulled new files: `youtube_creators_import.csv` and `YOUTUBE_IMPORT_GUIDE.md`.

3. **Inspected import script and CSV:**
   - Found header mismatch; generated a fixed CSV with correct headers for import.

4. **Tested import in a safe environment:**
   - Ran dry-run imports using SQLite and confirmed no effect on backend data.

5. **Prepared for real import:**
   - Updated `.env` to use production PostgreSQL settings.
   - Installed missing Python dependencies.
   - Attempted to start Django server; encountered DB password error.

6. **Reset PostgreSQL password:**
   - Updated password for `crm_user` to `5514`.
   - Updated `.env` accordingly.

7. **Database did not exist:**
   - Created `crm_db` database owned by `crm_user`.

8. **Migration errors:**
   - Migrations failed due to existing tables and constraints in `crm_db`.
   - Dropped and recreated the database multiple times, but migrations still fail with `cannot drop table crm_customer because other objects depend on it`.

## Current Problem

- **Django migrations cannot complete** because the `crm_db` database is not empty, even after dropping and recreating it.
- The error is:
  > cannot drop table crm_customer because other objects depend on it
- This means there are still tables and constraints in the supposedly new database, which should not happen if the database was truly dropped and recreated.

## Recommendation
- Manually verify the database is empty after dropping and recreating it:
  1. `sudo -u postgres dropdb crm_db`
  2. `sudo -u postgres createdb -O crm_user crm_db`
  3. `sudo -u postgres psql -d crm_db -c "\dt"` (should show no tables)
- If tables still exist, there may be a connection to the wrong database instance or a permissions issue.
- Once the database is confirmed empty, rerun migrations and start the server.

**Please have your dev server verify the database state and migration process.**
